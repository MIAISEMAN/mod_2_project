    "She has hired us to deliver insights about several factors that might help her decide on which artists to manage or book for residences in Vegas. As a jumping off point, we will answer the following questions: \n",
    "1. Are self-released albums rated differently than the wider population?\n",
    "2. Are \"best new music\" albums more prevelant in a certain genre?  BONFERRONI IF MULTIPLE CHECK\n",
    "3. Of the highest-rated labels, does on label have more \"best new music\" albums than the others(could do pop or could to other top ten?\n",
    "4. Does one reviewer tend to review more harshly than all the other reviews? \n",
    "5. Reach Goal: Look at the artists with at least one album review from 1999-2009 and at least one album review from 2014-2017. Of the top (three) highest-rated artists, is their recent album scored better than the average 2014-2017 album?"
