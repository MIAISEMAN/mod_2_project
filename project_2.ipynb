(What if other websites for music reviews operate much differently? What if we had data from before 1999 or after 2017, which is not the case here? Most importantly, what if Pitchfork only reviews a certain subset of the overall album population?) Since it is the dataset that we have, it will serve as \"random enough.\" \n",

    "Each review is for an album which is released by a record label, except in the case of the self-released albums. They are released by the artists themselves. \n",

    "Even if we find that self-released albums are typically scored lower, we only want to know if this is a $statistically significant$ amount lower. Therefore, we'll decide on an $alpha$ value that will indicate the number of false positives we are comfortable having. As the chance of false positives goes up, the chance of false negatives goes down and vie versa. So we want to think about which one we are more comfortable getting. In this case, a false positive (type 1 error) would be that we say self-released albums are scored lower but they are not scored lower. A false negative (type 2 error), would be that we say self-released albums are scored the same or higher, but they are scored lower. In our estimation, Taylor could potentially ignore all of these self-released artists needlessly with a false positive, so false positives should be minimized. A false negative, however, is not as bad because she may still include self-released albums in her pool of potential musicians to represent. We put this false-positive-acceptance-rate into a number called $alpha$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$alpha =.025$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? Assume we do this same hypothesis test 40 different times, and each time the results tell us to accept that the self-released albums score lower. $alpha=.025$ indicates we are comfortable being wrong only one of those forty times."
